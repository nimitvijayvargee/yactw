yet another corny terminal webpage
This is a simple terminal website, vibecoded with 20 lines of HTML and a massive vanilla JS switch statement. It does not work on mobile (at all, you won't even get past desktop mode). The site has some commands you can try out, and read more on some of my projects! I plan to update the content on this site regularly, so do check back every now and then!

## Commands
- `help` : List all the commands available
- `ls` : List all files in the current/specified directory
- `clear` : Clear the terminal screen
- `cat [file]` : Navigate and view a file! (only text files for now)
- `cd [dir]` : Change directory to another directory! (Only /projects/ for now) Use `cd root/` to return to root.
- `toggle-overlay` : Toggle the screen effects overlay (lines and fade).
More commands to be added later!

## Deploying
there isn't much to do, all the important files are available in `/site/`. Download the 3 files and keep them in the same directory. Open `index.html` in your browser.
