                        deskRGBM (Desktop RGB matrix) is a cool ornamental side project I made for hackclub highway!
                        this
                        project was made to be a fun little toy that can connect to a computer and use Vial (yes,
                        the
                        keyboard
                        app) to control cool effects on a small 8x8 RGB Matrix. There is also a singular rotary
                        encoder
                        you
                        can
                        use to cycle the colours, effects, brightness and speed. This project was a small, easy to
                        follow
                        PCB
                        project. It also helped to learn to solder SMD components (somewhat), and I really enjoyed
                        making
                        this

                        working on
                        getting the software for this optimized, but hope to have everything be controllable with a

                        MateInGreen is a random chessbot I made using python that uses the basic minimax algorithm to
                        play
                        chess! it works, albeit not that good. it can make moves, castle and so on. it's built with
                        pygame
                        to
                        render the board so you can play with the bot as well, rather than typing your commands into the
                        terminal! I later inplemented alpha-beta pruning in order to drastically speed up the bot,
                        although
                        the
                        depth is still quite less. <br />
